# Private-Events

<p>This project is part of the Ruby on Rails course from The Odin Project.</p>
<p>The purpose of the application is to enable users to log in, create and join events. A user can participate in many events, events can have many participants.</p>
<p>The main goal of this project is to get used to using mana-to-many relationships, foreign keys, and class names without relying on Rails default settings.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed description of the assumptions: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events#introduction">Odin Private Events</a></p>
